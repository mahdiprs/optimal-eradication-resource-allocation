# Optimal allocation of resources between control and surveillance for complex eradication scenarios

## Overview
This repository provides a prototype implementation of our method for optimal resource allocation between control and surveillance in invasive species eradication programs. Developed using R, this code is designed to make our analytical Bayesian framework accessible to a wider research community, facilitating reproducibility and application in various ecological and biosecurity contexts.

## Code Files
- **example.R**: Runs models under different assumptions, demonstrating how to apply the Bayesian framework to evaluate various resource allocation strategies.
- **funcs.R**: Includes core functions for performing resource allocation calculations, and analysing uncertainty.

## Usage
1. **Load Functions**: Begin by sourcing `funcs.R` to make all functions available in your R environment.
2. **Run Simulations**: Use `example.R` to perform analysis under different uncertainty conditions.

## Dependencies
Make sure the following R packages are installed:
- `ggplot2`
- `dplyr`
- `stats`
- `symengine`
- `data.table`
- `gridExtra`
- `magrittr`
